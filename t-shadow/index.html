The `paper-shadow` element is a helper to add shadows to elements.
Paper shadows are composed of two shadows on top of each other. We
mimic this effect by using two elements on top of each other, each with a
different drop shadow. You can apply the shadow to an element by assigning
it as the target. If you do not specify a target, the shadow is applied to
the `paper-shadow` element's parent element or shadow host element if its
parent is a shadow root. Alternatively, you can use the CSS classes included
by this element directly.

Example:

    <div id="myCard" class="card"></div>
    <paper-shadow id="myShadow" z="1"></div>

    // Assign a target explicitly
    myShadow.target = document.getElementById('myCard');

    // Auto-assign the target.
    <div class="card">
      <paper-shadow z="1"></paper-shadow>
    </div>

    // Use the classes directly
    <div class="card paper-shadow-top paper-shadow-top-z-1">
      <div class="card-inner paper-shadow-bottom paper-shadow-bottom-z-1"></div>
    </div>

If you assign a target to a `paper-shadow` element, it creates two nodes and inserts
them as the first children of the target, or the first children of the target's shadow
root if there is one. This implies:

  1. If the primary node that drops the shadow has styling that affects its shape,
     the same styling must be applied to elements with class `paper-shadow`.
     `border-radius` is a very common property and is inherited automatically.

  2. The target's overflow property will be set to `overflow: visible` because the
     shadow is rendered beyond the bounds of its container. Position the shadow as a
     separate layer and use a different child element for clipping if needed.
